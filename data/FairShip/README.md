# Cascade files for the beam dump facility

In order to sample heavy mesons at the beam dump facility, you need to obtain the corresponding ROOT files, which have been produced by the SHiP collaboration by simulating the interaction of protons on a thick molybdenum target as well as the secondary interactions (cascade) resulting from the re-interaction of their decay products with the target material.
These files contain lists of heavy mesons along with their momenta in the lab frame.

The following two files should be placed in the current folder:

#### Charmed mesons:
  * Name: `Cascade-parp16-MSTP82-1-MSEL4-978Bpot.root`
  * MD5: `402535074194f9c4bec79fe6333c95af`
  * Size: 10700664629 bytes (10 GB)

#### Beauty mesons:
  * Name: `Cascade-run0-19-parp16-MSTP82-1-MSEL5-5338Bpot.root`
  * MD5: `29140ca106955a75a113c0ff569117f8`
  * Size: 73473802 bytes (70 MB)

Although these files are currently not publicly accessible, you may request them from the SHiP collaboration or from the authors.
